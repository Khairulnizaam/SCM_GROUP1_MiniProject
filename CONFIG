Step by Step working with GitHub Repository and Visual Studio 2015

#Step 1
Start with creating a Repository on GitHub. To do that navigate to https://github.com/ and click on + sign to create a new repository. I am assuming that, you have already created an account in GitHub.


Next you need to provide information such as:

Name of the repository
Description of the repository
Whether repository is public or private
Whether to initialize repository with a README.

Make sure not to initialize the repository with a README. If you do so, you will get some error while syncing the project to the repository.  Once repository is created, click on Clone or download dropdown and copy the web URL as shown in the image below. We need GitHub repository URL later in Visual Studio.

#Step 2
Install Git for Windows on the machine. You can download it from here  https://git-scm.com/download/win . After downloading follow the screens to install git on windows.

#Step 3
Open the visual studio solution, you want to publish to GitHub repository in Visual Studio. In Visual Studio Solution Explorer, right click on the solution and click on Add Solution to Source Control.

#Step 4
Next open Team Explorer by pressing Ctrl+M or opening from View->Team Explorer. In the Team Explorer, click on Home icon and then select Sync option.
On the next screen, enter GitHub Repository URL (from step 1) and click on publish.

Next you will be prompted for GitHub credentials, enter that to sync or publish Visual Studio project to GitHub repository.

To verify whether project got successfully published, navigate to GitHub.com and open the repository, you should find project from Visual Studio listed here.

Sync the changes:
After successfully publishing of project, you can commit the changes to the sever also.  After changing the code, right click on the solution in the solution explorer and select Commit from the context menu.

Next you will be asked to enter the comment for Commit.  After entering commit message click on Commit All.

On the next screen click on Sync as shown in the image below

 On the next screen click on Push in Outgoing Commits section.

After successful push, you should get message successfully pushed to origin/master as shown in the image below
In this way, you can sync work on project in Visual Studio to GitHub Repository.


Cloning GitHub Repository in Visual Studio:
Cloning a repository is very simple. To clone, launch Visual Studio and open Team Explorer.  To clone a repository, you need to provide two information

GitHub repository URL:
Empty folder in which repository will be cloned.
Click on connect button in Team Explorer and provide GitHub repository URL and folder name to clone the repository locally.

 After successful clone, open the folder you will find projects from the GitHub repository.
